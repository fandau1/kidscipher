# Letter Number Cipher (A1Z26)

The Letter _Number Cipher_ (also known as _A1Z26 Cipher_) is one of the simplest substitution ciphers. The idea is straightforward — every letter in the alphabet is replaced by its position number. **A** becomes **1**, **B** becomes **2**, and so on, all the way to **Z**, which becomes **26**.

## Encoding

To encode a message, simply replace each letter with its alphabetical position number. A separator (like a dash `-`) is used between numbers so they can be unambiguously read back.

- **H** → position **8** → `8`
- **E** → position **5** → `5`
- **L** → position **12** → `12`
- **O** → position **15** → `15`
- **W** → position **23** → `23`

So "HELLO WORLD" turns into a sequence of numbers separated by dashes — easy to write down, but not immediately obvious to someone who doesn't know the trick!

## Decoding

To decode, just do the reverse — take each number and find the letter at that position in the alphabet:

1. Split the encoded message by the separator (`-`)
2. Convert each number back to its corresponding letter (1 = A, 2 = B, …, 26 = Z)
3. Concatenate the letters to get the original message

Spaces in the original message are typically encoded as `0` or preserved as a space between groups of numbers.

## Example

**Input:** <code>{exampleInput}</code>

**Encoded:** <code>{exampleEncoded}</code>

**Decoded:** <code>{exampleDecoded}</code>

The decoder reads `8` as the 8th letter of the alphabet (H), `5` as the 5th letter (E), `12` as the 12th letter (L), and so on — reconstructing the original message step by step!
